## Developer side

I've been an independent developer for 5 years, but I should have started much earlier, at least tried.

I hope this platform will help you take the plunge. Instead of responding to job ads, you post your preferences. Do you prefer VueJS over React? Or the opposite ? It's up to you.

There is only one form to fill out, and :

 - **Free** registration only takes 2 minutes, unlike other platforms.
 - It is not the agencies or the recruiters who contact you, but the tech leads or CTOs directly, which means an interview or two less to plan.
 - There is no commission taken by the platform on your work, the payment is only on the recruitment side.

## Recruitment side

This platform is for both developers and recruiters.

I try to make it inclusive and accessible to everyone.

If you're desperately short of time to recruit and don't want to spend a fortune on recruiting, jsdevs is for you.

I do my best to ensure that only qualified profiles register on the platform.

I hope you will find the profile you are looking for, without intermediaries or agencies.

I'm here to help you, personally if necessary, you can send me an e-mail at <a href="mailto:contact@jsdevs.co" class="underline">contact@ jsdevs.co</a>
