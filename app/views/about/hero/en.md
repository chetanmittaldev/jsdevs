Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm [Joe Masilotti](https://masilotti.com). I'm building `lovindevs` to make it easier for web developers to find their next gig.

`lovindevs` is being built around three core values:

1. Empowering the independent developer
1. Doing everything in public
1. Creating a safe, inclusive environment
