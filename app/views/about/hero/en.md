Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm [David Boureau](https://github.com/bdavidxyz/). 

I'm building `jsdevs` to make it easier for JavaScript developers to find their next gig, and also make the recruitment process easier.

`jsdevs` is an official fork of `railsdevs`, by [Joe Masilotti](https://masilotti.com/), who originally built it for Rails developers.
