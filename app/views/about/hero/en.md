Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm [David Boureau](https://github.com/bdavidxyz/). 

I'm building `lovindevs` to make it easier for web developers to find their next gig.

`lovindevs` is a fork of `railsdevs`, by [Joe Masilotti](https://masilotti.com/), who originally built it for Rails developers.

`lovindevs` is being built around the same three core values:

1. Empowering the independent developer
1. Doing everything in public
1. Creating a safe, inclusive environment
